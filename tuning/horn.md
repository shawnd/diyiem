# Horn's

Horning or trumpeting is a techniqued used to emphasize high frequencies. This can be accomplished at the exit hole or bore hole of the IEM. An increase in the size of the bore hole from the driver to the exit will result in creating a horn.

Higher frequencies can also be enhanced by enlarging the bore size.

A shorter canal also helps improve higher end frequencies.

If a tube narrows towards the end, it will have the opposite effect and reduce high frequencies.
