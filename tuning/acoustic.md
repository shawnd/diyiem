# Acoustic Filtering

Acoustic filters, such as Campfire Audio's [TAEC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5R8zm_5kJk) (Tuned Acoustic Echo Chamber) or 64 Audio's FXC (Frequency Expansion Chamber), can change the frequency response of your drivers and the color of the sound. This is accomplished by utilizing the principles of acoustic chambers.

The size and shape of the chamber can change the frequency response of its output. This is useful for when we wish to tune the frequency response of certain frequency ranges.
