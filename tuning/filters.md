# Filters

In IEM's passive electronic filters are typically accomplished by using capacitors and resistors.

## Low Pass Filter

Low pass filters cut frequencies about a defined threshold. This is useful for subwoofers and mid drivers, and you can set cuts from 200hz or 2000hz respectively.

## High Pass Filter

The opposite of a low pass filter. This cuts frequencies below a defined threshold. Primarily useful for tweeters as you can set the high pass filter to 6kHz and filter out all frequencies below 6kHz.

## Band Pass Filter

This is a combination of both low pass and high pass filters. Filtering out frequencies above and below two defined thresholds. For example, a mid driver might want to cut all frequencies below 200Hz and above 2kHz.

## Capacitor and Resistor Types

Ceramic capacitors are preferable. Nobium have higher tolerance going up to 20% and tantalum's interference at breaking omega point.

For resistors precision wirewound add a subtle flavour and make the background blacker. Wirewound seems to reduce noise. Metal foil/film would be for brilliance in treble region.

Wire wound - Smoother, organic tone and blackest space
Metal foil - Brilliant, detailed and have a good black background
Metal film - SuperBrilliant and is slightly noiser(this resistor is transparent)
Carbon resistor - Warmer, good for bass point cross or zobel. It makes treble muddier . distorted background
Carbon film - warm, smooth and velvety background. Noise is least offensive, hissing is tonally warm and bearable by ear.(you may enjoy the hissing/sensitivity as its not sharp like transparent resistor or it is distorted and rough like carbon)
