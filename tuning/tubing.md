# Tubing

Tubing connected to drivers can act as filters. This is done in a number of ways as outlined below.

It is worth noting that tuning with tubes has a cost, as tubes can introduce resonance to sound.

## Tube Length and Diameter

Longer tubes introduce lower frequency resonances. Larger tube diameters narrows and increases the resonances of the tube.

## Damping

This works by reducing airflow within the tube and clan help reduce resonance peaks in the frequency response curve, similar to reducing tube diameter. 

Only effective for high and mid frequencies.

Damper density = damper resistance or acoustic ohms. The greater the density (resistance), the greater the reduction in peaks of the frequency response.

Damping also reducing the output and gain of output.

Placement of the damping in the tube will influence its effect on the frequency response.

One issue with dampers is moisture buildup, they are typically made of nylon cloth and can absorb moisture.
