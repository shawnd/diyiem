# Balanced Armature Tuning

Balanced armatures are tuned using a variety of techniques. Below is a brief outline.

## Size & Volume

The size and internal volume of balanced armatures are a major factor in determining maximum output level.

The greater the volume, the greater the SPL.

## Mass & Stiffness

The mass and stiffness of the armature permit greater or reduced magnetic flux.

Increasing the mass of the armature increases magnetic flux, and improves low-end frequencies.

Decreasing the mass of the armature and and increasing armature stiffness increase the bandwidth of the driver but worsen low-end frequencies.

Obtaining extended frequency response from a single balanced armature driver is difficult, hence why there are dedicated, woofer, mids, and tweeters.

# Membrane

Larger members also move more air resulting in higher SPL, but this also limits the ability of the driver to produce higher frequencies.

Mass and stiffness of the membrane help define the position, relative amplitude, and Q of the BA driver's resonant peaks in the frequency response curve.

The position of the membrane also adjusts the loudness of the driver. A diagraphm higher in the housing allows for more rear volume of the driver, and therefore higher SPL.

## Sound Outlet

The shape and size of the sound outlet will cause resonance that color the sound. Hence the variety of spout positions, spoutless drivers, and also 64 Audio's TIA drivers with no lid, exposing the membrane.


## Venting

See [Vents](/drivers/ba/vents.md) page.

## Armature Dampening

Ferrofluids are used to dampen the driver, they are placed between the armature and magnets. This helps aid in dampening the resonant peaks

However, this type of dampening also reducing the SPL of the driver. On the plus side, dampening will also improve durabilty of the driver, reducing the liklihood of the driver hitting the magnets.
