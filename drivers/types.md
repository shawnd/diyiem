# Types of Drivers (Speakers)

## Dynamic Drivers

Most common type of driver. Electrical signal applied to voice coil creates a magnetic field. Coil and magnet interact to generate a mechanical force that causes the diaphgram to move back and forth, generating sound.

## Balanced Armature

Commonly used in IEM's and hearing aid devices. An electrical signal applied to a coil (1) causes an armature (2) balanced between two magnets and as a result moves the drive pin (3) which drives a membrane (4) to produce sound.

## Electrostatic

> Electrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated PET film membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated.

## Planar Magnetic

> A planar magnetic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets. A current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.
