# Center Tap

Some balanced armature drivers will have three contact pads: positive, negative, and half tap.

The half tap or center tap pad when used will act as positive and will increase the SPL's of the higher frequncy ranges while sometimes reducing lower frequency SPL's.

This is useful when you want to use a driver like a CI-22955 as a mid or an ED-29864 as a high-mid.
