# Vents

## Drivers

Some balanced armature drivers have small vents in the housing, this allow for more volume of air to be exchanged, typically resulting in greater SPL.

Often these vents can be closed, with tape or other adhesive material to reduce the bass output of these vented drivers.

Also when placing drivers next to each other, it is crucial to be cognizant of blocking vents. A potentially blocked vent can result in an undesirable sound tuning which may be hard to identify later. 


## Shells

Vents can also be used for pressure equalization in the ear canal. This is especially useful for reducing ear fatigue due to vacuums created in the each when the IEM is inserted. 64 Audio APEX modules work using this principle, and typically with the mid and low frequency ranges which tend to move more air than high frequencies.

One downside of venting shells can be reduced isolation, meaning more external sounds can be heard by the listener.
