# Wiring

There are two primary ways of wiring speakers, in parallel and in series.

# Series

Wiring speakers in series is when one wier goes from one speaker to the next.

To calculate total impedance you simply add the ohms of each individual component.

Higher impedance makes it harder for the amplifier to drive output.

# Parallel

Two wires are used to connect from one speaker to the next.

Most common way of wiring speakers.

To calculate total impedance of all components have the same impedance, simply add all impedance and divide by number of speakers.

To calculate total impedance of all components that have different impedance use the formula: ImpTotal = 1 / (1/Imp1) + (1/Imp2) + ... (1/ImpN)
