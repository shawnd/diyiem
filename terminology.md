# Terminology and Audio Concepts
## In-Ear-Monitors
IEMs are devices used by musicians, audio engineers and audiophiles to listen to music or to hear a personal mix of vocals and stage instrumentation for live performance or recording studio mixing. They are often custom fitted for an individual's ears to provide comfort and a high level of noise reduction from ambient surroundings.

Because the external ear is bypassed and the ear canal blocked, the natural response of an adult ear canal is about 3kHz. IEMs have to compensate for "the loss of canal resonance," making it difficult and undesirable to target a perfectly flat response

## Impedance 
Impedance is the device’s electrical resistance to the current being pushed through it. The lower the impedance, the easier it is to get higher volume and requires less power.  

I wonder what impedance value would be the best... I consider 20-40 Ohms. Output should fit 110-130dB...impedance (DC) is important - higher impedance less bass.

## Sensitivity
Sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. This indicates how loud the headphones will be for a given electrical drive level. The sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125 dB/mW.  Devices with a higher sensitivity are generally louder when supplied with any given audio source.

## Frequency Response 
FR is the range of sounds that the speaker is able to produce.  Technically speaking, humans can hear frequencies between 20Hz - 20kHz but it can be argued that our practical range is more closer to 20Hz - 17.5kHz.

## Balanced Armature 
BA is a subminiature speaker component different than the classic round dynamic speakers.

Because the external ear is bypassed and the ear canal blocked, the natural response of an adult ear canal is about 3kHz. IEMs have to compensate for "the loss of canal resonance," making it difficult and undesirable to target a perfectly flat response

## Sibilance
Sibilance is a sound characterized by pronouncing words with the letter 's'. In audio reproduction the letter 's' should sound clear and distinct, not smeared or distorted as in 'sh'. The letter 's' should sound like a hissing sound.  One philosophy is that an audio system should reproduce the word 'sizzle' clearly and distinctly without sounding smeared or distorted.

## Distortion
Unclear audio signal that results from giving too much power to a speaker or amplifier.  This could manifest itself in the obvious form of pops and hisses and the not-so-obvious form of generating sound in frequencies  that should not exist.  For extample, playing a 4kHz test tone and significant signals are observed down in the 1.5kHz frequency range.  

## What is “headroom”?
Excerpt from http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb10/articles/qa0210_4.htm
Every audio‑passing system (analogue or digital) has two limits: at the quiet end there is the noise floor, normally a constant background hiss into which signals can be faded until they become inaudible; and at the loud end there is clipping, the point where the system can no longer accommodate an increase in signal level and gross distortion results. The latter is generally due to the signal level approaching the power supply voltage levels in analogue systems, or the coding format running out of numbers to count more quantising levels in digital systems.

Obviously, we need to keep the signal level somewhere between these two extremes to maximise quality: somewhere well above the noise floor but comfortably below the clipping point. In analogue systems, this is made practical and simple by defining a nominal working level and encouraging people to stick to that by scaling the meters in a suitable way. For example, VU (volume unit) meters are scaled so that 0VU usually equates to +4dBu. The clipping point in professional analogue gear is typically around +24dBu, so around 20dB higher than the nominal level indicated on the VU meter.

That 20dB of available (but ideally unused) dynamic‑range space is called the headroom, or is referred to as the headroom margin. It provides a buffer zone to accommodate unexpected transients or loud sounds without risking clipping.

More headroom means you have to worry less about transient peaks causing clipping distortion, and generally translates to a more open and natural sound, so it's a good thing.
