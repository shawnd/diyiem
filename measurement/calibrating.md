# Calibrating

In order to calibrate your equipment without have a reference microphone, take a measurement of a balanced armature or IEM and cross reference an existing measurement from an online database of the same item. Then calculate the difference in SPL and save this file as your microphone calibration.

Calibrating your soundcard requires plugging in the output into the input and running the calibration with REW.
