# Measurement

Measuring your IEM's are crucial for tuning the frequency response and creating the type of sound signature your are after.

Furthermore measuring your balanced armatures for frequency response and impedance can help fill gaps where data sheets are not available.

If you do have a datasheet you can convert the graph into an FRD or ZMA file to use with software such as VituixCAD to test your crossover design prior to warming up the soldering iron.
